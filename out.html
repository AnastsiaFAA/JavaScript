And they additionally provide multiple opportunities for TV and video professionals to examine the potential of significant new technologies, such as <STRONG>ATSC 3.0/Next-Gen TV, autonomous vehicles, Blockchain, artificial intelligence/machine learning, voice assistants, VR/AR</STRONG>, and more.</SPAN></P>

However, this library may not have the model you need for your specific problem.</p> <p>Speaker Bio: Nicole Carlson</p> <p>Nicole is a Data Scientist at ShopRunner. Prior to that, she worked at Shiftgig, the University of Chicago, the Exploratorium, and Automatic. She received a PhD in Physics from the University of California Berkeley. On the weekends, Nicole teaches middle school and high school girls how to program at the Girls Who Code club of the University of Illinois Chicago.</p> <p>In contrast, PyMC3 is a library that allows you to create almost any model you want using its probabilistic modeling framework. But most of the examples on using the library are in Jupyter notebooks. Additionally, they often only demonstrate how to train on one set of data.</p> <p>What Nicole has found missing are the steps between creating a PyMC3 model and reusing that model with new data in production.</p> <p>This talk will go over an example of how to train a model in scikitlearn, save it for later use, and reload it to use with new data. Then, she will map those steps to the corresponding methods in PyMC3.</p> <p>The bulk of the talk will be a demonstration of a custom Hierachichal Logistic Regression class that’s built on top of the scikitlearn API. At the end of the talk, you should be able to take this model as a template for any of your own PyMC3 models.</p> <p>About Metis</p> <p>Metis (thisismetis.com) accelerates careers in data science by providing full-time immersive bootcamps, evening part-time professional development courses, online resources, and corporate programs based in Seattle, New York, Chicago, and San Francisco.</p> <p>Brought to you by Kaplan, Metis focuses primarily on Python, machine learning, data visualization, deep learning, big data processing, statistical foundations, and more.

We'll discuss keras-pandas, a new framework for rapidly building deep learning pipelines for numerical, categorical, and other data types.</p> <p>Main talk (~30 mins + Q&amp;A): Controlling a Quantum Computer with Python, Steven Heidel</p> <p>Building quantum computers presents a number of obvious challenges across theoretical physics, hardware design, and electrical engineering. Less often considered is the enormous amount of new and innovative software that is needed. Compilers that understand quantum programming languages, data analysis tools for making sense of measurements, and high performance device drivers for executing quantum machine instructions are all examples of the new software that is needed to control a quantum computer. In this talk I’ll go over the progress that’s been made so far, where we still need to go, and the large role that Python plays in building that software.</p> <p>About Steven: Steven is a senior software engineer at Rigetti Quantum Computing. He works on building control software for quantum computers and is the maintainer of the open source quantum programming toolkit PyQuil. Prior to Rigetti he was a tech lead at LinkedIn for 3 years where he maintained an open source Scala library for microservice query optimization.</p> <p>AGENDA</p> <p>6:00p - Check-in and mingle, with food provided by our generous sponsor Zenefits!</p> <p>7:05p - Welcome</p> <p>7:30p - Door close</p> <p>7:10p - Announcements, lightning talks and main talk</p> <p>8:15p - More mingling</p> <p>9:30p - Hard stop</p> <p>**SF Python is run by volunteers aiming to foster the Python community in the Bay Area.

Reports are being used to make crucial company decisions. Your reputation is on the line to be sure of the accuracy of the data being reported. It is critical that you have confidence in your data pipeline execution.</p> <p>Your data pipelines are complex and changing often. Regressions are possible from minor changes to DAGs and tasks. This may have unintended impacts on tables, and data flow which may not be discovered until much later and data has been already used in reports. Also, failure and DAG outages occur. You need confidence that when failures are fixed, that data is ‘flowing’ again and things are back to normal. Finally, complex ETL demands accuracy when data is mission critical. How do you know that your ETL is copying all rows accurately? That your joins are not dropping any data?</p> <p>This training gives you practical, real-world examples of tests that can be added to any data pipeline to provide you with the confidence that things are working as expected.</p> <p>What will I learn?<br/>The class will include hands-on activities and provide pseudo-code examples of tests that can be run against your tables and data models. You will learn about the different classes of tests, how to set them up, and the important metrics to monitor.</p> <p>How will this help my company and me?<br/>Accurate business decisions, confidence that data quality is valid, and no more guesswork or surprises about data quality. Sounds great, right? Once you’re freed from worrying and fighting fires, you can refocus on your being creative with your data and have the confidence to make changes.</p> <p>*** If you can’t make this time, no worries. Register anyway, and we’ll send the recording and the slides afterward.</p> </div><br><br><h3 class="title"><a href=https://www.meetup.com/Humans-not-Resources/events/251208251/ target=blank>Workshop: Using Data & Ideation to Bring Company Values to Life</a></h2><br><div class="date_time"><strong>Date: </strong> 2018-06-14T12:00:00</div><br><div class="desc"><strong>Description:</strong> <p>*This is a paid workshop.

But how many organizations actually ensure their values are both understood and meaningful to their employees?</p> <p>Humans not Resources, partnered with Culture Amp, is proud to present a special workshop: Using Data &amp; Ideation to Bring Company Values to Life. Led by Chloe Hamman and David Osberg of Culture Amp, attendees will work together in small groups through a sequential series of short exercises to learn how to:</p> <p>- Work with their employees and leaders to discover their values or “uncover” important values that haven’t been previously identified</p> <p>- Use employee feedback via surveys and focus groups to identify what employees truly value</p> <p>- Clearly define for each value:</p> <p>- Its meaning</p> <p>- Its business relevance</p> <p>- The social conditions required to bring the value to life in the context of the organization (aka, “mutuality”)</p> <p>- Use ideation techniques to transform abstract values into meaningful, innovative practices that improve employee engagement and business outcomes</p> <p>Courtney Bigony of 15Five will also highlight the process they used to develop specific rituals for each of their values to ensure they’re a meaningful part of the employee experience. Recommendations on how other companies can do the same will be shared. Courtney will explain how companies can incorporate values into their employee feedback and development processes.</p> <p>This workshop is limited to 50 seats so please register early!</p> <p>Link to register: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/workshop-using-data-ideation-to-bring-company-values-to-life-tickets-46302494006" class="linkified">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/workshop-using-data-ideation-to-bring-company-values-to-life-tickets-46302494006</a></p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>12:00pm - 1:00pm: Networking and Lunch</p> <p>1:00pm - 2:00pm: Workshop</p> </div><br><br><h3 class="title"><a href=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/maps-at-your-fingertips-on-demand-tactile-maps-for-the-blind-tickets-43913312901?aff=ebapi target=blank>Maps, at Your Fingertips: On-Demand Tactile Maps for the Blind</a></h2><br><div class="date_time"><strong>Date: </strong> 2018-06-14T13:30:00</div><br><div class="desc"><strong>Description:</strong> <P><SPAN CLASS="il">Blind</SPAN><SPAN> and visually impaired communities have little to no access to graphic information that would help them learn about their surroundings. Braille and tactile maps have proven useful, however, historically these maps have been difficult and costly to design, manufacture, and distribute. </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN>Tactile Maps Automated Production (TMAP) is a tool for on-demand creation of tactile street maps. TMAP is an accessible, web-based app, using Google maps search information and OpenStreetMap data to generate tactile and visual representations of streets centered on a user-specified location. Using design parameters to ensure tactile legibility, TMAP quickly and cheaply generates tactile map files that are compatible with a variety of printers and embossers.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN>We will demonstrate the need for tactile maps and graphics and maps and of their value to people who are </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="il">blind</SPAN><SPAN> or visually impaired. We will discuss the competencies needed for tactile literacy as well as considerations for designers to create excellent tactile graphics. Starting from a basic understanding of the Braille Authority of North America’s Guidelines and Standards for Tactile Graphics, we will add our own experiences as daily practitioners of the tactile arts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN> </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>Are you feeling anxious and stressed? You have a lot of company. Anxiety often creates the feeling of panic, uneasiness and fear. While anxiety can be a normal part of life, anxiety disorders now affect over 40 million Americans—that’s 18% of the population.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>The good news is cannabis can also have a direct effect by lessening the intense feelings of anxiety. New research shows that </SPAN><A HREF="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-017-4648-z" TARGET="_blank" REL="noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow"><SPAN>when patients are treated with cannabis, not only did their subjective levels of stress decrease but so did biological markers such as cortisol levels</SPAN></A><SPAN>. This happens because compounds in the plant, such as cannabidiol (CBD), stimulate the endocannabinoid system’s CB1 receptor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>In this interactive discussion, HelloMD will speak with Alison Ettel, the Founder of Treatwell, to learn the “what” and the “how” of treating anxiety and stress with cannabis. We will discuss how to manage anxiety and stress with cannabis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>Some of the questions we will cover in this workshop:</SPAN></P>
<UL>
<LI><SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>How does cannabis work within our bodies?</SPAN></LI>
<LI><SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>Why does cannabis work to alleviate anxiety and stress?</SPAN></LI>
<LI><SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>What part do cannabinoids play in the treatment of anxiety?</SPAN></LI>
<LI><SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>How does cannabis help anxiety in lieu of pharmaceuticals?</SPAN></LI>
<LI><SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>What cannabis products work best in the treatment of anxiety?</SPAN></LI>
<LI><SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>Do I need to be “high” in order to treat my anxiety and stress?</SPAN></LI>

<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>Alison Ettel has worked with patients that suffer from anxiety and stress across CA and has anecdotally seen the results that cannabis may provide. </SPAN></P>

Tesla is working towards production lines staffed entirely with robots. According to Elon Musk, “People will maintain the machines, upgrade them, and deal with anomalies.” Companies like Waymo are building driverless cars and creating new paradigms for how humans will interact with them. These technological feats have dominated headlines in recent years but many more lesser-known automation experiences already permeate our lives. Financial management websites like Wealthfront are using AI and machine learning to automatically build their clients’ portfolios and maintain diversification. Credit card companies use chatbots to automatically notify their customers of potential fraud and allow them to resolve issues with a simple text message. And Flexport, a global trade technology company, is working towards automating how goods are moved around the world. Along with all of these new technologies come complex social, communication, quality, and trust issues which we’ll discuss on our diverse panel of industry experts.</P>

You’ve built the next big FPS or MMO multiplayer game! You have a game client and a dedicated game server binary ready for players to connect to, but now you’ve got to write code to spin up game server processes, fire up machines to run them, autoscale them, and so much more!</p> <p>Thankfully, there are multiple open source projects that are available to do much of this work for you, and get your multiplayer game up and running at global scale as fast as possible.</p> <p>In this talk we’ll discuss and demo the open source project Agones, currently being developed by Google Cloud Platform in conjunction with Ubisoft. Built on top of the open source, software container orchestration system Kubernetes, it provides a batteries-included solution for running dedicated game servers at scale anywhere - be-it in the cloud, on your own hardware, or across all of the above.</p> <p>7:30 - 8:00 - Debugging Cloud-Native Applications with the Conduit Service Mesh - Franziska von der Goltz, Buoyant</p> <p>In this talk, we dive into how a service mesh can be used for debugging microservices. A service mesh is an increasingly popular way to add reliability, security, and visibility to a cloud-native application. While service meshes provide a wealth of features, including service discovery, load balancing, retries, and timeouts, one primary benefit they bring is in instrumentation and telemetry about the application. We demonstrate how this data can be used to address critical debugging problems that are unique to microservices, by giving you a view into service behavior across the entire infrastructure without needing to change application code.</p> <p>8:00 - 8:30 Social, Wrap-up, Jet</p> <p>Bio/Briefs(s)</p> <p>Mark Mandel is a Developer Advocate for Google Cloud Platform, founder of the open source, multiplayer dedicated game server scaling project Agones and one half of the Google Cloud Platform Podcast. Hailing from Australia, Mark built his career developing backend systems and writing open source software.</p> <p>Twitter: @Neurotic</p> <p>Franziska von der Goltz is a software engineer working on open-source service mesh technology at Buoyant. Prior to Buoyant, she was a part of the education team at the Hackbright Academy in San Francisco, an engineering school for women with a mission to change the ratio in the tech industry.

<P>Additional Information:<BR><SPAN>----------------------------------------------------------------------</SPAN><BR></P>
<P>Werqwise is a collaborative workspace designed to enable businesses and professionals to work smarter by focusing on the physical and emotional elements that support companies and employees in their quest for success. Developed from data-driven research, Werqwise believes how you work, where you work and who you work around fundamentally impacts a business’s or an individual’s success.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P>Located ideally south of the Financial District in bustling San Francisco, Werqwise is within walking distance to the Moscone Center and major transportation hubs, making it the perfect base for a workplace in San Francisco. </P>
<P><BR></P>
<P>Sustainability at all levels is important to CEO Alan Mackay and the Werqwise team. The team puts a significant effort into ensuring the collaborative workspace has sustainable features, such as assimilating recycled fishing line floors, compostable cups, and water filling stations. Werqwise uses Kisi, an app-based security and door access system, so there is no need to produce and distribute access cards. The building systems have also been fully upgraded to ensure they exceed the latest California standards for air flow/outside air and power usage/control. </P>
<P><BR></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal">Rather than focusing on designer preferences and current fashions, Werqwise develops its environments based on basic human needs, motivation, personality, and experiences. Based on workplace psychological research, Werqwise developed activity-based workspaces, allowing members the freedom to choose a working environment for each specific task and thereby improve productivity. </P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal">At the intersection of design and psychology, Werqwise built a healthier and more productive environment focused on transterior design -- the philosophy of bringing the outdoors in. Elements such as flora, color, materials, layout and light, which can positively influence both physical and mental health, were all taken into consideration when designing the space.</P></div><br><br><h3 class="title"><a href=https://www.meetup.com/Nebulas-U-S-Meetup-Bay-Area/events/251338013/ target=blank>Blockchain JavaScript Developer Friday Open Office </a></h2><br><div class="date_time"><strong>Date: </strong> 2018-06-15T10:30:00</div><br><div class="desc"><strong>Description:</strong> <p>Nebulas recently announced Developer Incentive Program:</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/nebulasio/the-nebulas-incentive-program-starts-now-with-nearly-3-million-in-rewards-e7a1399addc2" class="linkified">https://medium.com/nebulasio/the-nebulas-incentive-program-starts-now-with-nearly-3-million-in-rewards-e7a1399addc2</a></p> <p>During the Incentive Program, Nebulas will open its office to all Javascript Developers who are interested to build DApp on Nebulas.</p> <p>In this open office, you can work with your own team or meet other developers to discuss ideas, troubleshoot, and develop DApps to turn into the incentive program.</p> </div><br><br><h3 class="title"><a href=https://www.meetup.com/Startups-Showcase-VI/events/250189031/ target=blank>Live Sharks Tank® Startup Expo & VIP-party w/$50k in prizes</a></h2><br><div class="date_time"><strong>Date: </strong> 2018-06-15T18:00:00</div><br><div class="desc"><strong>Description:</strong> <p>Welcome to "Live Sharks Tank" this event is for anyone all ages are welcome!

Project Indigo is an application that allows Corda to integrate with Soverin's decentralized identities for its permissioned network by using the protocols developed by Indy.</p> <p>Indy is a Hyperledger project focussed on the creation of a decentralized identity system for permissioned blockchains (<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy" class="linkified">https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy</a>). Corda is an open-source blockchain platform (www.corda.net).</p> <p>In the course of his talk, he will discuss the benefits of a decentralized approach to identity as well as the implications that decentralized identities have on application architecture.</p> <p>About the Speaker<br/>Joel Dudley is the co-maintainer of the Corda blockchain platform and it is his role to foster third-party contributions to Corda. He joined the Corda platform team when Corda was still a members-only, closed-source platform, and has been working hard to dispel that image for the past 18 months.</p> <p>His career in tech doesn’t extend back much further than that, having previously worked in insurance. Fortunately, he's heard that youth and inexperience are highly-valued qualities on the Bay Area tech scene.</p> <p>----------------------</p> <p>Talk 2: Blockchain Monitoring and Analytics</p> <p>Shawn Douglass from Amberdata will provide an analysis and share insights into monitoring blockchain networks with specific emphasis on network integrity, limitations, transaction throughput, and .</p> <p>About the Speaker<br/>Shawn Douglass is CEO of Amberdata, a platform for monitoring, searching, analyzing public and private blockchain. Prior to founding Amberdata, Mr. Douglass served as President of Software and CTO at Unified, building and operating the company's rapidly-expanding SaaS offerings in cross-platform data management, analytics, and reporting.

We propose digging deeper to understand not simply the most engaged users, but those who’ve found something in your product that transforms the way they think. In this talk, we’ll share how our data science and research team worked collaboratively to conduct retention analysis, customer segmentation, and cohort definitions. Together we uncovered a group of users who’ve used UserTesting to democratize research and change their company culture. These are the customers we want to serve and replicate.

This Maptime is an active, open build session to get hands-on with some data on protected areas, parks, and species sitings. As at all Maptime events, this is open to all levels and degrees of knowledge-with intentional support for the beginner! Dan Rademacher from GreenInfo Network will introduce some data sources on Bay Area parks to maptimers, and Mapbox volunteers will be on hand to support building a static or web map with Mapbox Studio and Mapbox GL JS. Don't worry if that sounds complex!</p> <p>Maptimers can work on three tracks, depending on their skills, to create a beautifully styled nature map, and learn a lot of interacting with open data on the way. Maptimers can work on three levels:</p> <p>--Beginner: Create a map style in Studio with custom data to use as a simple web map or static map. *No code required.*<br/>--Intermediate: Build an interactive nature locator web map. Kickstart your map with some template code and add in data and interactivity. (Requires some familiarity with javascript.)<br/>--Advanced: Add more features to the Intermediate map (e.g. add search, find nearest X near me, filtering options etc.), explore the Uploads API and other programmatic tools. (Requires more familiarity with javascript.)</p> <p>Maptime always seeks to open the doors of cartographic possibility, and offer a space to learn about mapping tools. Those who attend s will work with part of CPAD, an open dataset of California parks and protected areas developed by GreenInfo Network (www.calands.org). We'll use Mapbox tools to map protected areas in relation to roads, wildlife, accessibility or public transit, or other data--feel free to bring your own database to make a nature map! Since we'll be using some cool MapBox tools. It may be helpful to look at Mapbox tutorials in advance. (Watch this site for some suggestions on useful tutorials.)</p> <p>A big thanks from MaptimeSF/OAK to the folks at GreenInfo Network, and especially their ED, Dan Rademacher, who will presentthe CPAD database, and Marena Brinkhurst and the Support Trio at Mapbox for offering this session.</p> <p>As always, Maptime is collaborative, simultaneously flexible and structured, creating space to feature independent/collaborative work time and healthy conversation and some networking among all who love maps. We seek to provide a relaxed collective learning environment. We're especially interesting in discussing new mapping tools in a space for people to create and learn together. Our goal is to provide a safe space for mapping with an open heart and without pretension.</p> <p>Some people are experts, and some people are just getting started, but all of us are learning--which it's always best to do together!</p> </div><br><br><h3 class="title"><a href=https://www.meetup.com/AWS-SANFRANCISCO/events/251281894/ target=blank>eero CTO on privacy and data security for startups</a></h2><br><div class="date_time"><strong>Date: </strong> 2018-06-19T19:00:00</div><br><div class="desc"><strong>Description:</strong> <p>What tools and processes should you now consider when building out your company’s privacy and security – and for making a customers' home a safe haven?</p> <p>Whether you’re a startup, small business, or enterprise company we invite you to a fireside chat with eero’s Co-Founder and CTO of Hardware Nate Hardison. eero is the world's first whole home wifi system that delivers fast, secure wifi to your home.</p> <p>Hardison will share his thoughts on why it’s imperative that startup companies design their products and networks with security in mind.
